        <h1>SAP in Information Technology: A Comprehensive Overview</h1>
        <p>SAP (Systems, Applications, and Products in Data Processing) is a global leader in enterprise software, revolutionizing how businesses manage their operations and IT infrastructure. This page provides an in-depth look at SAP's role in IT, its evolution, architecture, modules, benefits, and its alignment with modern technological trends.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Introduction to SAP</h2>
            <p>SAP, founded in 1972 in Walldorf, Germany, by five former IBM engineers, is a multinational software corporation specializing in enterprise resource planning (ERP) software. Its mission is to help businesses run better by providing integrated solutions for managing core business processes such as finance, logistics, human resources, and supply chain management.</p>
            <p class="highlight">SAP's flagship product, SAP ERP, has evolved into SAP S/4HANA, leveraging in-memory computing to deliver real-time insights and streamlined operations.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>History of SAP</h2>
            <p>SAP's journey began with SAP R/1, a financial accounting system, followed by SAP R/2 for mainframe computing. In the 1990s, SAP R/3 introduced a client-server architecture, making it accessible to a broader range of businesses. The launch of SAP ERP in the 2000s and SAP S/4HANA in 2015 marked significant milestones, incorporating advanced technologies like in-memory databases and cloud computing.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>1972:</strong> SAP founded by Dietmar Hopp, Hasso Plattner, and others.</li>
                <li><strong>1980s:</strong> SAP R/2 targets large enterprises with mainframe solutions.</li>
                <li><strong>1990s:</strong> SAP R/3 introduces modular, scalable ERP solutions.</li>
                <li><strong>2010:</strong> SAP HANA, an in-memory database, revolutionizes data processing.</li>
                <li><strong>2015:</strong> SAP S/4HANA launches, built on HANA for next-gen ERP.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>SAP Architecture in IT</h2>
            <p>SAP systems are built on a three-tier architecture:</p>

                <li><strong>Application Layer:</strong> Processes business logic, transactions, and workflows.</li>
                <li><strong>Database Layer:</strong> Stores data, with SAP HANA enabling high-speed, in-memory processing.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>SAP HANA, the backbone of modern SAP systems, uses in-memory computing to process large datasets in real time, significantly improving performance compared to traditional disk-based databases.</p>
